            <p>I'm your average computer nerd who loves everything about technology. I hope to make an impact in tech wherever I can.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I am currently a senior attending Texas A&M University. I am majoring in Computing while specializing in Geographical
                Information Systems.</p>
            <p> Computing is a new major at A&M. The Computer Science department wanted to diversify their students by
                allowing them to learn other things while learning the foundations of Computer Science. The Computing major allows students to take other fields of interest
                so they can combine what they learn with Computer Science to create amazing things.</p>
            <p>
              I have found an interest in GIS and decided to put my focus in that area. I hope to combine the two fields one day to make an awesome project one day.
